        <p>What's the difference between the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max?</p>
        <p>iPhone XS has a 5.8-inch OLED display and the iPhone XS Max has a 6.5-inch OLED display, meaning the iPhone Xs Max is larger; however, other than that, there is no difference between the two new phones on the inside.</p>
